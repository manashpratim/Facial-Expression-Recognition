# Facial Expression Recognition
Categorize face based on emotion displayed
# Description
In this project, I have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow and Keras to classify facial expression. The Facial Expression Dataset 2013 (https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) consists of 28709 training images and 7178 test images. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The model achieved a training accuracy of 99.3% and a validation accuracy of 60.74%.
